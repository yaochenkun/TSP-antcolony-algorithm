# TSP-AntColonyAlgorithm
An implementation of TSP(Traveling Salesman Problem) by Ant Colony Algorithm in Java.
## Details
* Solve TSP in Java.
* Adopt Object-Oriented.
* Divide into 5 Classes: __AntAlgorithm__, __Ant__, __City__, __Road__ and __Constant__.
* Verify respectively in 3 different size of cities: 10 cities, 20 cities and 31 cities.

## Classes
* __AntAlgorithm__: controls the whole algorithm's life cycle including initing all the ants, choosing the next city and simulating the round trip for each ant, updating pheromone for each road.
* __Ant__: portrays the serveral actions of ant such as initing the birthplace, choosing the next city, arriving the next city.
* __City__: contains the id of city, the sum of visibility and pheromone with weight, and the possibility to be choosed by one ant.
* __Road__: contains the distance and the pheromone of each road.
* __Constant__ï¼šcontains the data of map, the initial value of pheromone(C), the max number of round trips, the number of ants, the flow-rate of pheromone and so on.
